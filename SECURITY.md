# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**At this time, all versions of `pbm-root` (not `pbm_r`)
are supported.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a serious issue or security vulnerability,
contact @elemenom ASAP. Do not open a public issue
to prevent others from taking advantage before it is fixed.

If the issue is less serious, open an issue.
I often check the Issues page, and will fix the issue
as soon as possible.
